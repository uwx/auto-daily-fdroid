This is finally the release of version 1.0 of the app. It now has all initially planned *basic* features and has undergone many design overhauls.

**Features**

- List upcoming launches and events (e.g. space station activity)
- Show launch/event details and a countdown (including the date and time in your local timezone)
- List latest space news articles
- Subscribe to launches or events to receive notifications before the start or when times are updated
- Localization for English and German (UI only, data is in English)
- No internet? No problem! The app caches offline content for a few days and updates it when connected to the internet

Installation can be done as described in the README of the project.
