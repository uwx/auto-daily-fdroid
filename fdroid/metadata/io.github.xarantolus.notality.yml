    Notality is a very simple note taking app. I mostly built it to learn how Flutter works, but it's functional and you can use it.

    <b>Features</b>
    <ul><li>Create, edit, delete and reorder notes</li><li>Automatic dark/light mode depending on the system-wide setting</li><li>Localization for English and German</li></ul>
