Tachiyomi has removed almost all extensions from the official extensions repo. This update adds support for using the same external extension repos as Tachiyomi (they have a different URL format and can use non-github repos). 

You can add extension repos by going to settings -> browse -> edit repos

This was caused by some legal threat by Kakao Entertainment. If you want to blame someone, blame everyone who ever read Solo Leveling

What an absolute legendary trainwreck of a shitshow of an upgrade. Screw. This.

Where the hell is the honeycomb I worked so hard to curate over the last 5 years or so? How can they literally annihilate the UI/UX without providing any sort of option for the dedicated power users who spent a ludicrous amount of time setting that up?

Why did all the shortcut and action buttons change?! And - again - how the hell is there no option to change it back?!

I seriously almost don’t want to use the thing anymore. I just feel incredibly disrespected as someone who’s invested heavily into this ecosystem. It’s cool to try new things, it’s not cool to force us into it.

It’s like as if MacOS suddenly decided your menu bar was suddenly on the side of your screen instead of the top after so many years.

Seriously, what the fuck is this shit? If I had any idea how brutally they destroyed half of how I was used to operating this thing I would’ve never, ever upgraded.

I seriously can’t believe there’s no way back. :( screw you, apple.
