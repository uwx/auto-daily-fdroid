Summary: A GitHub client app built from ground up
Description: |-
    <b>Warning:</b> Upstream deleted fdroid flavor with some strange reasoning.
    Locked/deleted comments, general attitude suggest FastHub is gone forever.
    You could try its fork https://f-droid.org/packages/com.fastaccess.github.libre or
    FastHub-Revival instead (FastHub-Revival is not (yet?) in fdroid).

    Yet another open-source GitHub client app but unlike any other app, FastHub was
    built from scratch.
