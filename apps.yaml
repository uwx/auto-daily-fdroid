    Notality is a very simple note taking app. I mostly built it to learn how Flutter works, but it's functional and you can use it.

    <b>Features</b>

    - Create, edit, delete and reorder notes
    - Automatic dark/light mode depending on the system-wide setting
    - Localization for English and German
