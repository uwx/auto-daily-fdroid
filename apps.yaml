    Notality is a very simple note taking app. I mostly built it to learn how Flutter works, but it's functional and you can use it.
    <b>Features</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Create, edit, delete and reorder notes</li>
      <li>Automatic dark/light mode depending on the system-wide setting</li>
      <li>Localization for English and German</li>
    </ul>
