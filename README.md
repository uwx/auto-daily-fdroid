# fdroid
This repository hosts a [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) repo for my apps. It basically allows you to install and update apps very easily.

### How to use
1. At first, you should [install the F-Droid app](https://f-droid.org/), it's an alternative app store for Android.
2. Now you can [click this link to add this repository to your F-Droid client](fdroidrepos://raw.githubusercontent.com/xarantolus/fdroid/main/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=080898ae4309aeceb58915e43a4b7c4a3e2cda40c91738e2c02f58339ab2fbd7). Alternatively, you can also scan this QR code:

3. Open the link in F-Droid. It will ask you to add the repository. Everything should already be filled in correctly, so just press "OK".
4. You can now install my apps, e.g. start by searching for "Notality" in the F-Droid client.

### For developers
If you are a developer and want to publish your own apps right from GitHub Actions as an F-Droid repo, you can fork/copy this repo and see  [the documentation](setup.md) for more information on how to set it up.

### [License](LICENSE)
The license is for the files in this repository, *except* those in the `fdroid` directory. These files *might* be licensed differently; you can use an F-Droid client to get the details for each app.
